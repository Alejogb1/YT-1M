a research regardign how to graph the entire corpus of youtube and how to traverse it


regarding both of these what well-cited papers around this, already exist? 

Graph Construction:

Develop methods to collect and preprocess data.
Use graph libraries (e.g., NetworkX, igraph) to construct the graph.
Graph Traversal Techniques:

Explore different traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, A*).
Determine the traversal goals (e.g., finding shortest paths, identifying communities, detecting anomalies).
